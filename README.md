# Hi there! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a first-year Master's student focused on **AI research**, with a particular interest in utilizing deep learning to tackle emerging challenges in computer vision and machine learning.

## 🚀 About Me
- ☃️ **Academic & Research Focus**
  - As an undergraduate and early in my master's program, I focused on deep learning approaches for **set-structured data**, aiming to handle unordered collections effectively. During this phase, I explored methods to improve **confidence calibration** and **semi-supervised learning** for such data.
 
- ❄️ **Recent Achievements**
  - My research advancements led to the acceptance of my first-author paper at the main conference of the [**IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV 2025)**](https://wacv2025.thecvf.com/), one of the premier forums for computer vision research. I am honored to be presenting this work in March 2025 in Arizona, USA.

- 🔍 **Current Research:**
  - I am now venturing into the field of **Machine "Unlearning"**, a cutting-edge area dedicated to enabling AI models to selectively “forget” specific training data, enhancing privacy and compliance in real-world applications.

- 💻 **Development Experience:**
  - My portfolio includes a range of **personal apps** developed during my undergraduate years—feel free to explore them here:  [My Apps](https://wide-apps.com/apps).
  - I am also building **deep learning-powered applications** integrated with custom-trained models, leveraging frameworks like CoreML for efficient on-device inference.
